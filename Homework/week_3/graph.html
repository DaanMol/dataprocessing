    These are two charts displaying the employment rate in England.<br>
    The y-axis on the left displays a fairly small portion of the scale, as the changes in employment are qutie small<br>
    For reference, the scale in the right graph uses the entire percentile scale.<br>
    In the right graph the changes are barely noticeable, while the left graph displays them accurately.<br>
